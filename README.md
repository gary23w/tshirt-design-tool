## React Typescript/Axios/Node API/Mariadb T-Shirt Design Tool Prototype

This is a functional T-Shirt design tool prototype that utilizes React Typescript/Axios/Node API/Mariadb technologies.

### Usage

This tool has been designed to be implemented seamlessly with existing ecommerce platforms.

The T-Shirt design tool prototype allows for:

- Text manipulation inside the image editor with options for font selection via Google fonts API.

- Image import, with the ability to resize imported images.

- Design export for backing up or saving any current T Shirt designs in JSON format.

- Design import for loading exported item designs.

- T-Shirt color customization.
